### Fitbit Datasets

I obtained my Fitbit Data from Zenodo.org. The datasets were generated by 35 respondents to a survey (via Amazon Mechanical Turk) in 2016, from 12th March to 12th May.

The raw datasets contain:

- Daily Steps, Distance, Calories and Active Minutes
- Hourly Steps, Calories and Intensity Levels
- Steps, Calories, Active Minutes and Sleep data by Minute
- Heartrate in 1 or 5 second-interval
- Weight and BMI data

I worked on the 1st month of the datasets (instead of 2 months) to access if the datasets were suitable for developing a prediction model. 

Firstly, I performed data cleaning e.g. imputed participators' height using weight and BMI. Next, I merged the raw datasets (which were separated initially) by creating the following output files:

- activity.csv
- hours.csv
- minutes.csv
- seconds.csv
- weight.csv
