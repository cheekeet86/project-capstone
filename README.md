### Fitbit Datasets

I obtained my Fitbit Data from Zenodo.org. The datasets were generated by 35 respondents to a survey (via Amazon Mechanical Turk) in 2016 (12th March to 12th May).

The raw datasets contain:

- Steps, Distance, Calories and Active Minutes by Day
- Steps, Calories and Intensity Levels by Hour
- Steps, Calories, Active Minutes and Sleep Data by Minute
- Heart Rate by Second
- Weight and BMI Data

I worked on the 1st month of the datasets (instead of 2 months) to access if the datasets were suitable for developing a prediction model.

Firstly, I performed data cleaning e.g. imputed participators' height using weight and BMI. Next, I merged the raw datasets (which were separated initially) by creating the following output files:

- activity.csv
- hours.csv
- minutes.csv
- seconds.csv
- weight.csv

### FitRec Datasets

I decided to obtain another dataset from the FitRect Project (find out why in EPISODE III). The  datasets contains 253,020 workouts from 1,104 Endomondo users.

The raw dataset was stored as a single 6-gigabyte json file. I had to split the massive file into smaller json files (1,000 json per file initially but changed to 100 later for faster inspection in Notepad++).

Each workout contained detailed information e.g. gender, sport, location, altitude, timestamp, heart-rate and speed. However, there were missing information in the datasets e.g. no speed data for 80% of the workouts.

The smaller json files contains missing or additional data:

| Attribute | Unit | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Speed | km/h | Missing | Calculated using derived Distance and Time Difference |
| Distance | metre | Addtional | Derived from Latitude and Longitude using Haversine formula |
| Time Difference | second | Addtional | Time Difference between conseucitve Timestamp |
