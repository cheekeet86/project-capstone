Furberg, Robert; Brinton, Julia; Keating, Michael ; Ortiz, Alexa

- These datasets were generated by respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 03.12.2016-05.12.2016. 

- Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring.

- Individual reports can be parsed by export session ID (column A) or timestamp (column B).  

- Variation between output represents use of different types of Fitbit trackers and individual tracking behaviors / preferences.
