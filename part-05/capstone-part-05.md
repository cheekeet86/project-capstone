# ![](https://ga-dash.s3.amazonaws.com/production/assets/logo-9f88ae6c9c3871690e33280fcf557f33.png) Part 5: Presentation + Non-Technical Summary

## Overview

Whether during an interview or as part of a job, you will frequently have to present your findings to business partners and other interested parties - many of whom won't know anything about data science! 

That's why for Part 5, you'll create a 5-10 minute presentation that delivers the most important insights from your project to a lay audience. You've already done the analytical work; now it's time to explain your findings to the public.

Take your findings and share the most important insights from your project to a non-technical audience. Tell us the most interesting story about your data. Break down your process for a novice audience. Make sure to include compelling visuals. Time is short, so be sure to practice - and include only the most relevant components of your project.

Finally, be prepared to answer questions and explain your choices to an inquisitive audience!

**Goal:** A public presentation of your project, including an explanation of your model and findings for a non-technical audience.

## REQUIREMENTS

1. Host a 5-10 minute well-rehearsed presentation of your project for a non-technical audience.
   - Define technical terms and any basic data science concepts that inform your approach
   - Don't just deliver the information; tell a story about the problem and solution

2. Prepare polished visuals or a publicly-suitable slide deck to guide your presentation. 
   - Include graphs and/or visualizations

3. Make sure you cover the following areas:
   - Goals
   - Success Criteria / Metrics
   - Data
   - Overall Approach
   - Basic description of model
   - Findings
   - Risks/Limitations
   - Impact, next steps, conclusions
   
4. Successfully answer questions about your project from your audience.

#### BONUS

5. Discuss longer term potential of your project and model.
   - Describe how you could validate your model's performance over time
   - Explain how you would deploy your model in a production environment

6. Create a publicly hosted interactive visualization that your audience can use to further access and explore your data and findings.
   - Bonus points for embedding this into your blog post tutorial!

## Deliverable Format & Submission

- Format: Interactive graphic presentation, website, or slide deck.
- Public presentation of at least 5-10 minutes, with another 5 minutes of questions.

## Suggested Ways to Get Started

- Review the information you provided in the "Exective Summary" from Part 4. This is the same information you should cover here.
- The difference is that you should **not** assume that your audience knows anything about your problem, model, or basic data science. Structure your presentation as if explaining your model to a non-data science friend.
- Practice! Test your presentation on other GA students or friends and see where they have questions.
- Include more visuals (and less text) than you think.
- Don't just read your presentation - deliver it!

## Project Feedback + Evaluation

All projects have *requirements* that are clearly listed. These numbered requirements **must be completed** in order to "pass" the project. For each numbered item, you will be evaluated on a simple point scale of 0, 1, or 2. 

> In special cases, instructors may decide to award an additional point if a submission surpasses expectations or completes bonus objectives. 

Score | Expectations
:--- | :---
**0** | _Incomplete._
**1** | _Does not meet expectations._
**2** | _Meets all expectations._
**3** | _Bonus: Surpasses expectations; amazing!_
