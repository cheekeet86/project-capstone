#### REQUIRED

1. Host a 5-10 minute well-rehearsed presentation of your project for a non-technical audience.
   - Define technical terms and any basic data science concepts that inform your approach
   - Don't just deliver the information; tell a story about the problem and solution

2. Prepare polished visuals or a publicly-suitable slide deck to guide your presentation. 
   - Include graphs and/or visualizations

3. Make sure you cover the following areas:
