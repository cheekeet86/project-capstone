### Fitbit EDA

I performed preliminary analysis and created several charts for the datasets. Some charts include:

- BMI Scatterplot (Weight vs Height)
- Activity Level (e.g. high, sedentary) Distribution by participators
- Steps Count by Day (for 1 participator in 1 week)

I concluded that the datasets were not suitable for to build a model predictor. Some reasons were:

Missing Data:
- Some participators only had 1 week of data for the 1st month.
- Only 11 out of 35 participators had weight data.
- Only 50% of participators had heart-rate data.

Use-Case:
- It will be difficult to classify the participator id due to missing data.
- Needed a better use-case with more practical application.
- The datasets were more appropriate more individual fitness review than building a classification model.
