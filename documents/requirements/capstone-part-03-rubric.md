## Performance Evaluation
> Instructors: Mark sections with an `X` or `n/a` if a score does not apply. Grades and indiviual feedback are only necessary for numbered **"Required"** sections; bonus objectives are primarily intended for student enrichment.

#### RUBRIC

Score | Expectations
:--- | :---
**0** | _Incomplete._
**1** | _Does not meet expectations._
**2** | _Meets all expectations._
**3** | _Bonus: Surpasses expectations; amazing!_


#### REQUIRED
1. Create a "progress report" that documents:
   - Your approach to exploratory data analysis
   - Your initial results
   - Any roadblocks, setbacks, or surprises
   
2. Perform initial descriptive and visual analysis of your data.
   - Identify outliers
   - Summarize risks and limitations 

3. Discuss your proposed next steps
   - Describe how your EDA will inform your modeling decisions
   - What are three concrete actions you need to take next?


#### BONUS
4. Visualize your EDA and approach using at least **two or more** of the data visualizations methods we've covered in class.
5. Create a blog post of at least 500 words explaining your EDA so far, including your results, setbacks, and lessons learned. Link to this in your notebook.

## Score:
Based on the requirements, it is possible to earn a maximum of  **X**  points on this project. Your score is: **X**

- Remember, total scores are helpful as an indicator of how well you followed project instructions, but the most important feedback is to follow up on any actionable advice from your instructors for improving your project in the future!
