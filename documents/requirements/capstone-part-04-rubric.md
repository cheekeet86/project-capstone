## Data Science Immersive | Capstone, Part 4		
Your project criteria were derived from the following standards, taken from our data science workflow:

- [ ] Mine Data
- [ ] Refine Data
- [ ] Model Data
- [ ] Present Data

Acceptable performance for these standards is based on how well you've performed the specific requirements listed below.

## Performance Evaluation
> Instructors: Mark sections with an `X` or `n/a` if a score does not apply. Grades and indiviual feedback are only necessary for numbered **"Required"** sections; bonus objectives are primarily intended for student enrichment.

#### RUBRIC

Score | Expectations
:--- | :---
**0** | _Incomplete._
**1** | _Does not meet expectations._
**2** | _Meets all expectations._
**3** | _Bonus: Surpasses expectations; amazing!_

#### REQUIRED
1. Begin with an executive summary:
   - What is your goal?
   - What are your metrics?
   - What were your findings?
   - What risks/limitations/assumptions affect these findings?
   
2. Walk through your model step by step, starting with EDA
   - What are your variables of interest?
   - What outliers did you remove?
   - What types of data imputation did you perform?

3. Summarize your statistical analysis, including:
   - model selection
   - implementation
   - evaluation
   - inference

4. Clearly document and label each section
   - Logically organize your information in a persuasive, informative manner
   - Include notebook headers and subheaders, as well as clearly formatted markdown for all written components
   - Include graphs/plots/visualizations with clear labels
   - Comment and explain the purpose of each major section/subsection of your code
     - *Document your code for your future self, as if another person needed to replicate your approach*

5. Host your notebook and any other materials in your own public Github Repository
   - Include a technical appendix, inlcuding links and explanations to any outside libraries or source code used
   - Host a local copy of your dataset or include a link to a remotely hosted version

#### BONUS
6. Describe how this model could be put into real world production. Consider:
   - How could you continue to validate your model's performance over time?
   - What steps might you need to take to productionize your model for an enterprise environment?
   - How would you deploy your model publicly? What could you do to setup your model and share it online right now?

7. Create a blog post of at least 1000 words summarizing your approach in a tutorial format and link to it in your notebook. 
   - In your tutorial, address a slightly less technical audience; think back to Day 1 of the program - how would you explain and walk through your capstone project to your earlier self?


## Score:
Based on the requirements, it is possible to earn a maximum of  **X**  points on this project. Your score is: **X**

- Remember, total scores are helpful as an indicator of how well you followed project instructions, but the most important feedback is to follow up on any actionable advice from your instructors for improving your project in the future!
